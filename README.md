## About the Project
`CinemaScope` is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project exploring movie trends from 1990 to 2025. Leveraging data from The Movie Database (TMDB), this project provides insights into genre popularity, revenue evolution, rating patterns, runtime trends, and more. The core of the project is an interactive Streamlit dashboard, complemented by a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook and a machine learning model for movie popularity prediction.

### Objective
The primary objective is to analyze the evolution of movie trends over time, providing an interactive platform for users to explore the dynamics of the film industry from 1990 up to 2025.

### Tech Stack
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Streamlit)
* Async APIs (Aiohttp, TMDB API)
* Visualization: Plotly, Streamlit
* Feature Importance: Random Forest Regressor
* Deployment Ready: Interactive UI via Streamlit

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* A TMDB API Key. You can get one by registering at [TMDB Developers](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neehanthreddym/cinemascope-dashboard.git
cd Trending-Movies-EDA
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv <venv_name>
# On Windows:
.\venv_name\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv_name/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your TMDB API Key:
* Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project (Trending-Movies-EDA/).
* Add your TMDB API key to this file:
```
TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
* Important: Do not share your .env file or commit it to your repository.

### Data Collection
To collect the raw movie data (from 1990 to 2025), run the get_data.py script:
```bash
python scripts/get_data.py
```
This script will fetch movie data from TMDB and save it as tmdb_movies_1990_2025.csv in the data/ directory. It also logs its progress to logs/tmdb_data_collection.log.

### Training the ML Model
To train the Random Forest model for popularity prediction:
```bash
python scripts/train_rf_model.py
```
This script will load the cleaned data, train a RandomForestRegressor, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model to outputs/models/random_forest_model.joblib. It also logs its progress to logs/rf_training.log.

### Running the Dashboard
To launch the interactive Streamlit dashboard:
1. Ensure data is processed: The dashboard expects the processed data. The load_and_process_data function automatically handles cleaning and preparing tmdb_movies_1990_2025.csv and saves tmdb_movies_cleaned.csv.
2. Run the Streamlit app from the project root:
```bash
streamlit run scripts/dashboard.py
```
This will open the dashboard in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

## Usage
* `Explore Trends`: Use the Streamlit dashboard to interactively filter movie data by year range and observe changes in releases, revenue, ratings, popularity, and runtimes.
* `Deep Dive`: Refer to the 01_eda_trending_movies.ipynb notebook for a detailed, step-by-step Exploratory Data Analysis.
* `Data Pipeline`: Understand how raw data is collected and processed by examining get_data.py and data_processing.py.
* `Predict Popularity`: Leverage the train_rf_model.py script to understand the machine learning aspect of the project.

## Data Source
All movie data used in this project is sourced from The Movie Database (TMDB).
